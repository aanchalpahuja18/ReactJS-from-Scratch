Summary of Lect 1:
1. Hello World using HTML
2. Hello World using JS
3. Hello World using React by importing the cdn links
4. Extracting our piece of code into App.js file
5. We created the React element it is an object
6. We created the root in which all the elements created inside react will be rendered/ putted inside.
7. root.render() => To put the object that is the react element into our page. It is converted into html tag to make our browser understand it.
8. createElement API takes 3 arguments.
9. Whatever we are passing inside root.render() is getting replaced by the existing things in the root.
10. If suppose there is something in the top & bottom of the page we can still use react in some portion of the page which makes react a powerful library to use.
11. root.render() just affects the portion which is defined while creating it. Rest of the html remains same inside it and it is not affected by root.render()
12. React is a library and not a full fledged framework but then too we can make a large scale application from it.
We can also use react in our existing applications
