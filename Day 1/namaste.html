    <h1>Before root div</h1>
    <div id="root">
        <!-- <h1>Namaste React</h1> -->
        <!-- Comment 3: 
        The h1 tag will be replaced by the react code injected here.  -->
        <!-- Comment 4: 
        React is injected in this piece of code so it will only work here this makes react a 
        beautiful js library to be used only in a particular part of code  -->
    </div>
    <h1>After root div</h1>
    <!-- Comment 2
        Here all the statements written before and after root will be executed as it is since react is 
    not written in that part and it is only written in the div of id root -->
<!-- 
    <script>
        const heading = document.createElement("h1");
        heading.innerHTML = "Namaste React from Javascript";
        const root = document.getElementById("root");
        root.appendChild(heading);

<!-- Comment 1
Order of the above script files is important. Since if we write our App.js script file in the top we will get a Reference Error stating React not found. Therefore in order to first import our React file to allow our App.js file to make use of React -->
